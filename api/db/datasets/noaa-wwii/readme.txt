    ********  WORLD WAR II ERA SUMMARY OF DAY DATASET  ******** 


    This World War II era summary of day dataset was developed in
commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the war's end.  It
contains 1940-1945 data for 162 stations outside of the United
States.  The actual period of data availability varies depending
upon the station's activity.  Many stations in the European and
Pacific theaters of operation are included.  The files included
are:

readme.txt - this file, describing the dataset
format.txt - describes the format of the data
station-list.txt - a list of station locations for the dataset
country-id.txt - shows the country identifiers (2-character ID)
                 to cross-reference with 'station-list.txt'
ww-ii-data.txt - the data file (16 megabytes total)
map.gif - a global map of the station locations (gif image)

    Users can obtain the data via ftp to 'ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov',
logging in as 'ftp' or 'anonymous', and using their email address
as the password.  Simple ftp transfers of the 6 files will
download the data.  The data file has a 'header record' that
corresponds to the format file (format.txt).  The format file
also describes the included elements, such as maximum/minimum
temperature, daily precipitation, snow depth, and peak wind gust.
